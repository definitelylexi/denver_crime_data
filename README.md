## Dataset: Crime
Last updated 2/11/2019, [updated dataset](https://www.denvergov.org/opendata/dataset/city-and-county-of-denver-crime)

### Description
This dataset includes criminal offenses in the City and County of Denver for the previous five calendar years plus the current year to date. The data is based on the National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS) which includes all victims of person crimes and all crimes within an incident. The data is dynamic, which allows for additions, deletions and/or modifications at any time, resulting in more accurate information in the database. Due to continuous data entry, the number of records in subsequent extractions are subject to change. Crime data is updated Monday through Friday.

By downloading this data, you acknowledge that you have read and understand the Disclaimer below and agree to be bound by it. Certain information is omitted, in accordance with legal requirements and as described more fully in this Disclaimer.

All materials contained on this site are distributed and transmitted "as is," without any representation as to completeness or accuracy and without warranty or guarantee of any kind.

### About Crime Data
The Denver Police Department strives to make crime data as accurate as possible, but there is no avoiding the introduction of errors into this process, which relies on data furnished by many people and that cannot always be verified. Data on this site are updated Monday through Friday, adding new incidents and updating existing data with information gathered through the investigative process.

Not surprisingly, crime data become more accurate over time, as new incidents are reported and more information comes to light during investigations.

Crimes that occurred at least 30 days ago tend to be the most accurate, although records are returned for incidents that happened yesterday. This dynamic nature of crime data means that content provided here today will probably differ from content provided a week from now. Likewise, content provided on this site will probably differ somewhat from crime statistics published elsewhere by the City and County of Denver, even though they draw from the same database.

### Withheld Data
In accordance with legal restrictions against identifying sexual assault and child abuse victims and juvenile perpetrators, victims, and witnesses of certain crimes, this site includes the following precautionary measures: (a) Addresses of sexual assaults are not included. (b) Child abuse cases, and other crimes which by their nature involve juveniles, or which the reports indicate involve juveniles as victims, suspects, or witnesses, are not reported at all.

Crimes that are initially reported, but that are later determined not to have occurred, are called "unfounded" offenses. These incidents are excluded once they have been designated as unfounded.

### About Crime Locations
Crime locations reflect the approximate locations of crimes but are not mapped to actual property parcels. Certain crimes may not appear on maps if there is insufficient detail to establish a specific, mappable location.
